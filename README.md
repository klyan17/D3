# D3
D3 example for INFO 343

This example demonstrates a very simple example on how D3 can be implemented into a web app.  
Specifically, it is an app to supplement the board game Dead of Winter. Simply type in the amount  
of kills, one number for each round played, and the app will visualize the trends in your gameplay.  

D3 is very handy for data visualization to get points across. This could be used for anything from  
exposition to trendspotting. Data is a huge part of most websites today, and come in unwieldy databases  
or other difficult to manage forms. D3 allows developers to present their findings in a visually  
appealing manner.  
  
D3 is a very robust tool that has a very active and ongoing community. It is a popular tool, and there  
is actually an Informatics course dedicated to learning the tool (INFO 474).
